This is my submission for the **ZTM (Zero To Mastery) Challenge #44** â€” the goal was to build a complete application in **a single HTML file** using only **Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML**. Despite this limitation, the app is fully functional and easily extendable.

## âž• How to Add or Edit Questions

All quiz questions and answers are defined in a simple JavaScript array:

```js
const solutions = [
    {
        question: 'What can you use to style a Web page?',
        correct: [2],
        answers: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React Js.', 'Svelte']
    },
    {
        question: 'What does HTML stand for?',
        correct: [3],
        answers: ['Hyper Text Markup Lingo', 'Hyper Trait Markup Language', 'Hyper Text Markup Language']
    },
    ...
];
```

**To add a new question:**
1. Add a new object inside the `solutions` array.
2. Define:
   - `question`: The question as a string.
   - `answers`: An array of possible answers.
   - `correct`: An array of indexes (1-based) for correct answers.

âœ… That's it! No other changes are needed.
