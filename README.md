# Quiziz
Here is my submission to the open-source ZTM challenge 44. 
My app is a quiz game that allows the dev to easily add or change the questions just from modifying a simple JS array.

Tech stack:
- Vanilla JS
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla HTML

The point of the challenge was to only create one single file, but still make an app as complicated as you can.
